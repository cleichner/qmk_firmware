*Ideas*
add a cd .. macro and a /.. macro
Give a modifier to Vim for things like lookups
Nav layer, but for go-to-definition
modifier layer that adds a shift to all uses of control
homerow hyper/meh
case KC_MAKE:  // Compiles the firmware, and adds the flash command based on keyboard bootloader
Mac screenshot shortcuts: Command shift 3, command shift 4
Would it be cool to have a greek keyboard? E.g. for lambda and micro?
make sure I have a functional meta
might be cool to have keypad numbers for blender

*Open questions*
How does leader mode work?

Where do I put pg up and pg down? Raise layer, with the other navigation
Should I hardcode control+arrows? yes, pinkies instead of shift
How about cmd+shft+[ and cmd+shft+]? pinkies on the nav layer
backspace should be allowed to repeat, curl the thumb in, backspace for days

*Layer configuration modifiers*
DF(layer) - switches the default layer. The default layer is the always-active
base layer that other layers stack on top of. See below for more about the
default layer. This might be used to switch from QWERTY to Dvorak layout. (Note
that this is a temporary switch that only persists until the keyboard loses
power. To modify the default layer in a persistent way requires deeper
customization, such as calling the set_single_persistent_default_layer function
inside of process_record_user.)

MO(layer) - momentarily activates layer. As soon as you let go of the key, the
layer is deactivated.

LM(layer, mod) - Momentarily activates layer (like MO), but with modifier(s)
mod active. Only supports layers 0-15 and the left modifiers: MOD_LCTL,
MOD_LSFT, MOD_LALT, MOD_LGUI (note the use of MOD_ constants instead of KC_).
These modifiers can be combined using bitwise OR, e.g. LM(_RAISE, MOD_LCTL
| MOD_LALT).

LT(layer, kc) - momentarily activates layer when held, and sends kc when
tapped. Only supports layers 0-15.

OSL(layer) - momentarily activates layer until the next key is pressed. See One
Shot Keys for details and additional functionality.

TG(layer) - toggles layer, activating it if it's inactive and vice versa

TO(layer) - activates layer and de-activates all other layers (except your
default layer). This function is special, because instead of just
adding/removing one layer to your active layer stack, it will completely
replace your current active layers, uniquely allowing you to replace higher
layers with a lower one. This is activated on keydown (as soon as the key is
pressed).

TT(layer) - Layer Tap-Toggle. If you hold the key down, layer is activated, and
then is de-activated when you let go (like MO). If you repeatedly tap it, the
layer will be toggled on or off (like TG). It needs 5 taps by default, but you
can change this by defining TAPPING_TOGGLE -- for example, #define
TAPPING_TOGGLE 2 to toggle on just two taps.
